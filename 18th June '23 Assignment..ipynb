    "6. Set the logging level for each module or class. By default, the logging level is set to WARNING, which means only log messages with a severity level of WARNING or higher will be captured. If you want to capture messages with a lower severity level, you can set the logging level explicitly for each module or class.\n",
    "7. Specify the log file (optional). By default, the log messages are displayed on the console. If you want to store them in a file, you can specify the file path in the basicConfig call.\n"

    "Ans:\n",
    "    \n",
    "* Print( ): Display console output for ordinary usage of a command line script or program.\n",
    "* Logging is a means of tracking events that happen when some software runs. The software’s developer adds logging calls to their code to indicate that certain events have occurred. \n",
    "\n",
    "------------------------\n",
    "* logging.info() (or logging.debug() for very detailed output for diagnostic purposes)\n",
    "  * Report events that occur during normal operation of a program (e.g. for status monitoring or fault investigation) \n",
    "  \n",
    "\n",
    "* warnings.warn() in library code if the issue is avoidable and the client application should be modified to eliminate the warning.logging.warning() if there is nothing the client application can do about the situation, but the event should still be noted.\n",
    "  * Issue a warning regarding a particular runtime event.\n",
    " \n",
    " \n",
    "* Raise an exception \n",
    "  * Report an error regarding a particular runtime event.\n",
    "  \n",
    "\n",
    "* logging.error(), logging.exception() or logging.critical() as appropriate for the specific error and application domain\n",

    " \n",
    " \n",
    " ------------------------------------------------------\n",
    " \n",
    "* **Production environments**: When your application is running in a production environment, logging is the standard way to capture and store important information, errors, and warnings. It allows you to collect and analyze logs for monitoring, debugging, and auditing purposes. On the other hand, print statements are typically used for debugging during development and may clutter the output or impact performance in production.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Severity levels and filtering**: Logging frameworks provide various log levels (such as DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, and CRITICAL) to differentiate the severity of log messages. This allows you to control the verbosity of the output and filter logs based on their importance. You can configure your logging system to only display critical errors or specific types of messages, making it easier to focus on relevant information. With print statements, it's harder to achieve such flexibility and control.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Structured and formatted output**: Logging frameworks offer features to structure and format log messages consistently. You can include timestamps, log levels, source information, and contextual data in your log entries. This standardized format makes it easier to read and analyze logs, especially when dealing with large volumes of data. Print statements lack these features and can result in unstructured and unorganized output.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Log aggregation and centralized logging**: In complex systems with multiple components, it's common to aggregate logs from different sources into a centralized logging system. This allows for centralized storage, search, and analysis of logs. Logging frameworks provide integrations with such systems (e.g., ELK stack, Splunk, etc.) to forward logs efficiently. On the other hand, print statements would require custom implementation to achieve similar functionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Runtime configuration**: Logging frameworks allow runtime configuration, allowing you to change log levels, destinations, or formatting without modifying the code. This flexibility is useful when debugging an issue or adjusting the log verbosity in different environments. Print statements require code modifications for such changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Error handling and exceptions**: When an exception occurs, logging frameworks provide mechanisms to capture and log the exception details automatically. You can include stack traces, error messages, and relevant context information in the log entries, which can be crucial for troubleshooting and debugging. Print statements alone are not designed to handle exceptions in a structured and consistent manner.\n",
