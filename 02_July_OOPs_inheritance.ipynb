    "    \n",
    "**Single inheritance** \n",
    "----------------------\n",
    "* When child class is derived from only one parent class.\n",
    "* Advantages of Single Inheritance:\n",
    "    * Single inheritance is safer than multiple inheritance if it is approached in the right way. \n",
    "    * It also enables a derived class to call the parent class implementation for a specific method if this method is overridden in the derived class       or the parent class constructor.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
    " **Multiple Inheritance** \n",
    " ------------------------ \n",
    "* When child class is derived or inherited from more than one parent class.\n",
    "* In multiple inheritance, we have more than one parent classes/base classes and one child class that inherits all the  parent classes properties.\n",
    "* Advantages of Multiple Inheritance:\n",
    "\n",
    "    * Code Re usability: One of the most significant advantages of multiple inheritance is code re usability. By inheriting properties and methods          from multiple parent classes, a child class can reuse the code from those classes, rather than having to write the same code multiple times.           This can save time and effort and can help to make code more efficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "    * Flexibility: Multiple inheritance can make it easier to create complex class hierarchies that are flexible and adaptable. By allowing a class         to inherit from multiple parent classes, developers can create classes that can perform multiple functions and can be used in a variety of             different situations.\n",
    "\n",
    "    * Better Organization: Multiple inheritance can help to better organize code. By grouping related properties and methods into separate parent           classes, developers can create a more organized and modular code structure that is easier to manage and maintain.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Disadvantages of Multiple Inheritance:\n",
    "\n",
    "    * Complexity: Multiple inheritance can make code more complex and difficult to understand. With multiple parent classes, it can be challenging           to keep track of all the properties and methods that a child class has inherited, and this can lead to errors and bugs.\n",
    "\n",
    "    * Naming Conflicts: Multiple inheritance can create naming conflicts, where properties or methods in one parent class have the same name as             properties or methods in another parent class. This can make it difficult to determine which property or method is being referred to, and can         lead to errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "    * Diamond Problem: The diamond problem is a well-known issue with multiple inheritance. This problem occurs when a child class inherits from two         parent classes that both inherit from the same base class. This can create ambiguity in the code, and it can be difficult to determine which           inherited method or property should be used.\n",
    "\n",
    "    * Maintenance: Multiple inheritance can make code harder to maintain. With multiple parent classes, changes to one parent class can have                 unintended consequences on the child class or other parent classes. This can make it challenging to make changes to the code without                   introducing new bugs or errors.\n",
    "    \n",
    "------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    " **Difference between Single and Multiple Inheritance**\n",
    " ------------------------------------------------------\n",
    "* Single inheritance is a type of inheritance that enables a derived class to inherit attributes and methods from a single parent class while multiple inheritance is a type of inheritance that enables a derived class to inherit attributes and methods from more than one parent class.\n",
    "* In single inheritance, a subclass inherits from a single superclass whereas, in multiple inheritance, a subclass inherits from multiple superclasses. Hence, this is another difference between single and multiple inheritance.\n",
    "* Complexity is also a difference between single and multiple inheritance. Multiple inheritance is more complex than single multiple inheritance."
